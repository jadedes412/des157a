                <h3>Research Form Design</h3>
                <date>October 14, 2025</date>
                <p> The article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best Practices for Form Design" by Salim Ansari</a> outlined important principles and ideas to keep in mind when making forms. From the number of columns to where the input label is positioned, all these parts of designing a form can highly influence how the user interacts with it. I think that this article gave me a lot of things to consider that I haven't thought much about before, but not only do the principles in the article allow for the user to visually navigate it more easily, but by following these best practices, we can create forms that are accessible for everyone. 
                <br>
                <br>One website that I commonly use and have filled out forms through is the <a href= "https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa">FAFSA website</a>. The FAFSA form needs to take in a lot of information in different areas from different people like your family and parents. In theory it would be a lot of information on a page, but FAFSA sections out each category into its own "mini" form with less questions and less things to fill out. I also noticed that they minimized the use of dropdowns and had large spacing between questions to make it less overwhelming and easy to fill out.
