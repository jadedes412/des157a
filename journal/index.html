                <h3>Game Design Research</h3>
                <date>November 18, 2025</date>
                <p> The articles I read were <a href= "https://www.juegostudio.com/blog/game-design-principles-every-game-designer-should-know">"Game Design Principles"</a> by juegoodmin and <a href= "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/22/i-was-asked-to-invent-the-next-wordle-how-hard-could-it-be?ref=sidebar">"I was asked to invent the next Wordle. How hard could it be?"</a> by David Shariatmadari. When designing and programming a game, it is important to have some basic design principles and human behavior and needs in mind. The articles I read were really helpful and remind you to set clear goals for the player, to keep the things simple and fun, to make the game flow smoothly, and give feedback to the player. Even through it may seem like most people just click past these concepts, the game could feel confusing, or too difficult if certain design is not clear. This helped me gain more perspective on how important it is to design with the intention of making it enjoyable experience for the user. 
                <br></p>
                <p> I also learned about how important it is to make the game feel like it can and should be played again through the feedback/rewards. While it should be intuitive and easy to navigate, it can’t be too easy either. I think ultimately, the game design has to be considering how well it can be learned and played by users while also having an interesting factor to keep the user playing. </p>

                <h3>Form Design Research</h3>
                <date>October 28, 2025</date>
                <p> Visual thinking allows people to not just look at images but observe and understand an image or visual content. It is important in web interaction design too, because it can help us make web interfaces that are engaging and can appeal to the emotions of our audience. I took a look at the website: <a href= "https://epiminds.com/">epicminds.com</a>, which demonstrates visual thinking through one strong interactive hero visual that moves according to the user’s cursor. This website is advertising an AI assistant and does this effectively by giving this assistant a visual more tangible image and allowing the user to interact with it on the basic level. This made me gain deeper insight into how interaction and imagery can be used to give users a better understanding of something and be integrated into emotional design.

                <h3>Research Form Design</h3>
                <date>October 14, 2025</date>
                <p> The article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best Practices for Form Design" by Salim Ansari</a> outlined important principles and ideas to keep in mind when making forms. From the number of columns to where the input label is positioned, all these parts of designing a form can highly influence how the user interacts with it. I think that this article gave me a lot of things to consider that I haven't thought much about before, but not only do the principles in the article allow for the user to visually navigate it more easily, but by following these best practices, we can create forms that are accessible for everyone. 
                <br>
                <br>One website that I commonly use and have filled out forms through is the <a href= "https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa">FAFSA website</a>. The FAFSA form needs to take in a lot of information in different areas from different people like your family and parents. In theory it would be a lot of information on a page, but FAFSA sections out each category into its own "mini" form with less questions and less things to fill out. I also noticed that they minimized the use of dropdowns and had large spacing between questions to make it less overwhelming and easy to fill out.
