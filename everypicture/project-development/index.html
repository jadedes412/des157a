                <h2>Conceptual Changes</h2>
                <p> - instead of focusing on MOOD, focus on my cat's favorite places to loaf <br> - make the background more interactive rather than specific objects <br> - create more context because the user doesn't know what they are doing and focus on a storyline (add more text or some kind of description?)
                <br></p>
                <h2>Design Revisions</h2>
                <p> - use SVG image for the background that has specific hotspots around the room <br> - use consistent colors for the overlays but also make it stand out <br> - more round design and images to match the theme<br></p>
                <h2>Interaction Changes</h2>
                <p> - the cat is a custom cursor instead of hovering over <br>    - when cursor hovers, the default cat will turn into a cat that is loafing <br>     - based on certain areas /hotspots of the background image to visually demonstrate what happens in real life <br> - make the hotspots clickable for an overlay with more description of the cat that pops up <br>    - user should be able to click out of this<br></p>
                <h2>Concerns and Questions</h2>
                <p> - how can i create interactions that are intuitive and easy for user to get? <br> - what is best way to go about creating an interactive backgroud image with hotspots? <br> - i wanted to add different interactions too according to mood but i think that might be too many things going on<br></p>
